      <h2>Under the Cross</h2><br />
  </center>


  <p>Dear Friends in Christ,</p>

  <p>Have you ever walked among the cages at the Humane Society? You see pets that have no homes. Some are runaways. Some were deserted. Others had been abused. Often the animals have no identities. They're the unwanted. They're nobodies.</p>
  <p>If you're an animal lover, it's especially sad to think about their fate if no one comes to claim them or if no one shows mercy and adopts them.</p>
  <p>When did God adopt you? Have you been a Christian since you were baptized as an infant, or did you first come to know Christ as an adult? Maybe you strayed and abandoned your faith for a time.</p>
  <p>In any case, the verse paints a before-and-after picture for us. "Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy." Whether we were baptized when we were but a few hours old or whether we spent much of our lives away from Jesus, there was a time when we were not objects of God's mercy. In fact Scripture declares that we were "God's enemies."  We have seen the proof as recently as today. Every day our thoughts, words, and actions testify that the sinful nature still clings to us&mdash;a sinful nature that opposes everything God stands for.</p>
  <p>"But now," Peter says, "you have received mercy." God's heart went out to us. His Son came for us. His blood was shed for us. He raised to life a new man within us who delights in the sure hope of eternal life. He chose us to share the privileges of being called by his name&mdash;Christian. As his namesakes we have the privilege of bringing our requests to him in prayer, knowing that he will answer in a way that is good. As God's children we stand to inherit a home&mdash;a heavenly home. We have the promise that eternal treasures await us there.</p>
  <p>You went from a nobody to a somebody. Your name would have been quickly forgotten, except that God wrote it in the book of life. You've been brought into God's house. That house will stand forever!</p>

  <br />

  <p>In His Service,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
