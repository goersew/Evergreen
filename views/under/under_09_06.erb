      <h2>Under the Cross</h2><br />
  </center>

  <center><em>Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.<br/>Acts 2:2,3</em></center>

  <p>The name Pentecost comes from a word that means "50th." When God gave his Old Testament ceremonial laws, he designated the 50th day after the Sabbath of Passover week as a special holiday. It was a feast of joy to express thankfulness for the abundant fields, which were ready for harvest.</p>
  <p>How appropriate that Jesus chose Pentecost as the day on which to send his Holy Spirit to his apostles. Pentecost now marks the beginning of a worldwide harvest&mdash;not of grain brought into barns with implements but of souls brought into God's kingdom with divine fire. The joy of Pentecost was transformed from a physical harvest of grain to a spiritual harvest of souls.</p>
  <p>John the Baptist predicted this outpouring of the Holy Spirit years earlier. Referring to Jesus, he declared, "I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire." Jesus reaffirmed this prophecy. Just before his ascension, he commanded his disciples: "Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit."</p>
  <p>What happened on Pentecost was the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy. The Holy Spirit entered Jerusalem with "a sound like the blowing of a violent wind." Then they saw what appeared to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on them. The sound of the wind and the sight of flame symbolized the transformation that was taking place in the disciples' hearts. The Holy Spirit transformed those 11 timid men into fiery harvesters of souls.</p>
  <p>That harvest continues today. The fire of Pentecost has been passed down from generation to generation. Fiery harvesters take hold of Word and Sacrament to pass on that divine fire into dark, lifeless hearts. The Holy Spirit ignites more souls for God's harvest.</p>
  <p>That Pentecost flame is ours to share as we live and work in God's harvest fields.</p>
  <p>May God continue to bless the harvest!</p>




  <p>In His Service,</p>
