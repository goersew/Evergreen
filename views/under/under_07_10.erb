  </center>

  <p>Dear Friends in Christ,</p>

  <p>Stewardship of our finances asks us to consider giving to our congregation in a way that many of us have never been asked to give. The giving of our first fruits, as it states in Proverbs 3:9, means to prioritize our giving so that it becomes a part of our weekly and monthly household budgeting process.</p>
  <p>One of the ways we know whether or not our priorities are in order is by how we use the resources entrusted to us. Giving faithfully to the Lord's work is not just about money. It's about keeping our priorities in order. When we give faithfully and sacrificially, God not only works through our gifts to change lives through the ministries of our congregation, he changes us as well. Our sacrificial giving is one of the ways we grow spiritually as we learn to trust God and his promises.</p>
  <p>In Malachi 3:10 we read, "Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. "Test me in this," says the Lord Almighty, "and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour our so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it." We find similar promises in Proverbs 3:9-10; 11:24-25, and Matthew 6:32 and others."</p>
  <p>Once again this month we are going to focus on our calling as stewards of God's material resources. It's amazing how much Jesus spoke about the relationship between how we use God's money and our relationship with him. As we spend this month reflecting on our stewardship, I encourage you to spend some time in prayer. Ask God to reveal to you ways in which you could better use his resources for his will. I also encourage you to put God's promises of blessings and provision to the test. You will find that you cannot out give God.</p>
  <p>October 28th has been designated "Loyalty Sunday." A special mailing will go out to each member family on or about the 15th which will have details on how you can make your commitment to Evergreen.</p>
  <p>May the Lord bless each of us as we grow in our stewardship and our relationship with him.</p>

  <p>In His Service,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
