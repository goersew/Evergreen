  <p>Dear Friends in Christ,</p>

  <p>Perhaps today will be the first picnic of the summer for you. Perhaps you will work outside or go for a walk. Enjoy the evidence of the Creator's power and love in nature. But the greatest evidence of his power and love is found in the Sabbath-rest God has given us.</p>

  <p>Just as God rested from his creating work on the seventh day, God had a plan to grant us rest. In the Old Testament, God's people were commanded to set aside the seventh day of the week as holy to him. They were to rest physically from all labor. But that weekly Sabbath was only a shadow or picture to what God wanted to give. The author of Hebrews says, "There remains a Sabbath-rest for the people of God." He explained how we receive that rest: "Now we who have believed enter that rest." The rest that we enjoy is the rest that only Jesus can give---the rest of sins forgiven and everlasting life.</p>

  <p>The rest is more than just a day off. God invites us to enjoy that rest with our fellow Christians together in worship. Our Creator gives us rest in the means of grace; his Word and sacraments. As we worship, we are reminded of our sin. But we will hear that Jesus gives us forgiveness, peace, and rest. That's the rest he wants for us. So please listen to Jesus' invitation and join us this summer season for a rest truly refreshes both body and soul.</p>

  <p>In His Service,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
