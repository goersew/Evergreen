  <p>Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,</p>

  <p>How does a pastor spend the days he isn't preaching? His list of duties is endless: preparing for and teaching classes, visiting the sick and shut-ins, selecting hymns and liturgy for the Sunday bulletin, writing the monthly newsletter to the congregation, writing letters, attending pastoral conferences, preparing for and attending various congregational meetings, handling special services, studying Scripture, and much more.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you noticed one glaring omission from this list Ð prayer. Martin Luther said that there are three things that make a pastor: prayer, study of Scriptures, and the struggles of life (Oratio, Meditatio, Tentatio). He also remarked, "I have so many things to do today that I have to spend twice as much time in prayer before I begin."</p>
<p>A pastor must be a man of prayer. He prays daily, thanking the Lord for all the blessings he has been given by God's undeserved love and mercy. He sees himself only as a fragile jar of clay. Yet God has entrusted to him the Word of Life. He joyfully shares the message of Christ's salvation with the members Christ's flock. He is humbled by his own unworthiness yet confident that he can do all things through Christ who gives him strength.</p>
<p>He prays for the ability to properly distinguish between law and gospel. He knows that both must be preached Ð the law to hardened sinners, the gospel to troubled sinners. He prays that God would give him courage and the boldness to do God's work cheerfully, lovingly, and confidently.</p>

<p>He prays for himself and then for others. He prays for his wife, children and grandchildren. He prays that God will enable him to be a good husband, father and grandfather. He prays for wisdom to balance his time between congregation and family. He does not want to use his family as an excuse to neglect his congregation or vice versa.</p>
<p>He prays for the members of his congregation. He prays for all his flock, asking that God would give them hearts willing to hear the Word. He prays that God would give his people health, wisdom, love, and faith.</p>
<p>He prays for his people individually. He prays for those in the hospital, for those who have recently lost a loved one, for those having marital and family problems, for those experiencing financial difficulties, for those who have wandered from the Lord's house. Even though you may not see your pastor every day, he is praying for you. That's an important part of his work.</p>

  <br />

  <p>In His Service,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
