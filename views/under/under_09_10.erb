      <h2>From our Pastor</h2><br />
  </center>

  <p>Dear friends in Christ,</p>

  <p>May the grace and peace of our Lord be with you. Our Lord has blessed us so much that it is easy to take our riches for granted, surrounded as we are by so much abundance.</p>
  <p>Of course, the greatest gift of all that he has given us is the gift of himself, profoundly in our midst, as we gather in his name, listen to his Word, receive his body and blood, adore his real presence, and use his many gifts to build his kingdom. He fills us with his Holy Spirit and guides and directs our lives.</p>
  <p>We have a beautiful church to worship in, and the freedom to do so. We have a wonderful complement of brothers and sisters here to encourage us to truly live for God. His many gifts are truly without number. And what does he ask ing return? It's a simple exchange; he gives us everything; we give everything back to him. All that we have is a gift, St. Paul reminds us, and those gifts have one purpose, to build the kingdom. I see wonderful ways in which the kingdom is being dynamically built here at Evergreen&mdash;folks responding to the gentle urges of the Spirit as he guides and directs us. We have been blessed with an increase in membership, the largest confirmation class that I have had here, a record breaking enrollment in our preschool (42) and on and on it goes.</p>
  <p>To this end, each year we devote the month of October to emphasizing our stewardship drive and setting the budget for the coming year and so I would invite you to look at the needs of the congregation in terms of your tithing. However, while giving generously is related to our stewardship of the gifts given to us, the real goal of the program is to change our lives. We want to draw closer to the Lord Jesus Christ, to dedicate or rededicate every aspect of our lives to God.</p>
  <p>The Lord has always richly blessed us. I have no doubt that as we continue to seek his guidance, he will continue to do so. My profound gratitude to all of you as you do so much to build his kingdom in our midst. I commend you all into his care.</p>

  <p>In His Service,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
