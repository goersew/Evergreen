  <p>Dear Friends in Christ,</p>

  <p>The Lord has blessed this congregation with many gifts. Each believer has talents to use in the service of the Lord and his church. The early apostles understood that all believers have different gifts, according to the grace given us.</p>

  <p>WHen the tasks became too great for the apostles, they looked for help from the large group of people God had called to faith in Jerusalem. They advised the congregation to select men "full of the Spirit and wisdom" to assist in the distribution of food to the poor. The service or ministry of distributing food to the poor was important for the congregation in Jerusalem. By asking others to help, the church would free up precious time which the apostles could use to share the gospel. After all that was their primary goal.</p>

  <p>We have all ben brought to faith in Jesus and each of us has talents to use in the service of the Lord and his church. We should ask ourselves, "What is my role in the body of Christ? What useful service am I able to perform for the ministry of this congregation?"</p>

  <p>The apostles were uniquely suited for preaching and teaching in the early days of the church, but they could not have carried out the entire ministry of the church alone. They needed help and support from others to accomplish daily tasks important to the life of the congregation.</p>

  <p>God still selects and calls some to be pastors and teachers to fill the pulpits and the classrooms of our congregations and schools. This same Lord also asks many others to minister or serve his church. Ushers and organizers, visitors and greeters, painters and fixers, musicians and artists, cooks and cleaners, young and old; people from all walks of life can discover ways to use their talents to the glory of God.</p>

  <p>Pray that God will show you where your work in his kingdom is. And then ask for the strength and courage to take that step and share your talents and gifts with others as we together carry out the ministry that God has given us here at Evergreen. May God richly continue to bless our endeavors.</p>

  <p>In Christ,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
