      <h2>Under the Cross</h2><br />
    <p><em>And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another counselor to be with you forever √ê the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.<br />John 14:16,17</em></p>
  </center>


  <p>Dear Friends in Christ,</p>
<p>Students have guidance counselors. Married couples meet with marriage counselors. Counselors for almost any need are available in our day. They offer support, guidance, and direction to people who use their services.</p>
<p>Disciples of Jesus have another Counselor. He is a Counselor to whom they may turn in any and every need. Jesus promised this Counselor to his disciples who were with him in the upper room the night before his suffering and crucifixion.</p>
<p>Those disciples were feeling very low that evening. For three years Jesus had been at their side, visibly present. They had learned so much from him. They had come to know him as the Son of God, the promised Messiah. He had been their Counselor. They believed him to be the Good Shepherd, their leader and their guide. And so it came as a terrible shock to them when Jesus told them he was going away. To be without his presence and help and counsel was a dreadful prospect.</p>
<p>To comfort them, Jesus promised to ask his heavenly Father to give them another Counselor. Who would this Counselor be? "The Spirit of truth." He is the Holy Spirit who would be poured out on them in a special way on Pentecost. He would bring to their remembrance everything Jesus
had taught them. He would be with them forever. Jesus assured them, "The Spirit of truth... lives with you and will be in you." He would comfort, guide, and instruct them with the Word of God.</p>
<p>By the grace of God, the Holy Spirit lives with us and is in us. We haven't deserved this Counselor, for we were born spiritually dead and enemies of God. By birth we were like the children of this world who do not and will not accept the Holy Spirit as their Counselor. In baptism, however, we were born again, made spiritually alive. Through the Gospel of God's love for us in Christ Jesus, "the Spirit of truth" continues his gracious work in our hearts. He is our Counselor, who gives us peace through the forgive- ness of sins, comfort in our trials, confidence to pray in every need, and the assurance of eternal life.</p>

  <br />

  <p>In His Service,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
