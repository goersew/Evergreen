      <h2>Under the Cross</h2><br />
  </center>

  <center><em>Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters&mdash;one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."<br/>Matthew 17:4</em></center>

  <p>Dear Friends in Christ,</p>

  <p>Overwhelmed by the heavenly radiance of the Lord's glory, Peter had but one thought&mdash;to stay here and prolong this blessed experience.</p>

  <p>On Maundy Thursday, Peter was overwhelmed by his sinful nature. Three times he denied that he even knew Jesus.</p>

  <p>How could Peter do that? How could he see this preview of glory that Jesus gave him and then turn his back on Jesus, who was on the way to the cross for him? Surely Peter needed what comes to our minds on Ash Wednesday. He needed to repent.</p>

  <p>Repentance isn't putting ashes on the outside. It is the acknowledgment of sin and true sorrow from the heart for sin. But true repentance doesn't stop here, for sorrow can't pay for sin. Rather, true repentance looks in trust to him who could and did pay for sin. Peter was sorry. He wept bitterly. But he also had trust in the Savior who looked at him and called him back to himself&mdash;that Savior who had come to forgive him and restore to him the hope of glory.</p>

  <p>We look at ourselves. We too have had a preview of glory&mdash;the revelation of Scripture of oru God's salvation. But like Peter, we too fall. Instead of being overwhelmed by the glories of forgiveness and the promised resurrection life, we permit ourselves, only too often, to be overwhelmed by our sinful nature. We are no better than Peter. We too need Ash Wednesdays in our lives. We, every bit as much as Peter, need our Savior's loving look that invites us to him and promises forgiveness and glory.</p>

  <p>In life and death we are the Lord's. In life, though we have a preview of Jesus' glory in everything he has revealed to us, we still sin and show that we deserve death. But eternal death is not what God's grace gives us. The Transfiguration scene previews for us glory&mdash;a glory that our Savior has waiting for all who are his own.</p>


  <p>May God bless your Lenten journey,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
