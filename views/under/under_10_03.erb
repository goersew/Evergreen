      <h2>Under the Cross</h2><br />
  </center>



  <p>Dear Friends in Christ,</p>

  <center><p><strong>Did God really say...</strong> Genesis 3:1</p></center>

  <p>Did you ever find yourself trying to say no to something that someone was begging you to do? Sometimes saying no can be very difficult, especially if the person asking knows what buttons to push.</p>
  <p>Satan knows what buttons to push. And of all the weapons that he has in his evil arsenal, perhaps the most deadly weapon is the one he used on Eve in the Garden of Eden. Satan asked Eve, "Did God really say, You must not eat from any tree in the garden?" In effect Satan was saying "Really Eve? Is that really what God said? It doesn't sound like God loves you very much. And what about this command not to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil? Eve, you might think that God is taking good care of you, but I'm telling you that he's keeping all kinds of good things from you. You could be like God! If you don't believe me, take a bite of that fruit and find out for yourself!"</p>
  <p>One of Satan's favorite weapons is to plant seeds of doubt in our mind over what God said. Adam and Eve fell for Satan's lie, and the rest is history. So have many others down through the ages. Satan is still busy using that weapon today. He lures countless thousands into believing that God is not good, that we need to answer only to ourselves, and that we should make our own rules for the game of life. All those who continue to buy into that kind of godless thinking will experience that fires of hell.</p>
  <p>We can learn an important lesson from the garden that will help us fight against temptation. Satan will always try to plants seeds of doubt and will try to get us to question God's Word. When we fall into sin, let's flee for refuge to God's infinite mercy and lay hold of his gift of forgiveness. May God's loving forgiveness move us to stay close to the Lord who promises eternal life through Christ.</p>

  <br />

  <p>In His Service,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
