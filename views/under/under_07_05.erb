      <h2>Under the Cross</h2><br />
    <p><em>As you come to him, the living Stone--rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him--you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house.<br />1 Peter 2:4-5</em></p>
  </center>

  <p>Dear Friends in Christ,</p>
  <p>The apostle Peter says we are like living stones. How strange! A stone can hardly be called living. It is completely lifeless. It doesn't breathe or have a heartbeat. It can't move or communicate. We might describe stones as smooth, sharp, flat, round, or jagged. But living is not the way we usually describe stones. They are cold, hard, inanimate objects.</p>
  <p>That's why stone is an apt comparison to our hearts. By nature, we were cold and hard toward God. But Jesus, the living Stone, has given us life! We are living stones because of what Jesus has done for us. We are living stones because at our baptisms he gave us life. We are living stones because he has given us a glorious life with him in heaven forever.</p>
  <p>Living stones--it's an unusual term given to unusual people. Notice that Peter doesn't refer to us as bricks. Bricks are manufactured. Since they are all the same size and shape, it doesn't matter which brick is place first and which is put next to it. And it isn't a problem if one breaks. The next one will fit just as well in its place. No one will know the difference.</p>
  <p>Peter calls us stones. Stones aren't manufactured; they're created. Each one is unique in its color, shape, and size. More effort and thought is needed to build a stone wall, since stones need to fit well together.</p>
  <p>God has spent the effort and foresight to build you into his spiritual house--his church. There is no one quite like you in the kingdom, with your unique combination of gifts and abilities. Having received all the treasures of God's grace, we are to use these gifts to offer up spitiual sacrifices acceptable to God.</p>
  <p>God has blessed us with the privilege of being a part of his house. When God's house meets for worship and we're absent, we leave a gaping hole. When we're there, we give support and encouragement to all the others.'</p>

  <p>I hope to see you in church this Sunday.</p>

  <p>In His Service,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
