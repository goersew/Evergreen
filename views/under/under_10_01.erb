  <p>A Letter From Our Pastor:</p>

  <p><em>"Arise, take the Child and his mother, And go to the land of Israel, For those who sought the young Child's life are dead." Matthew 2:20</em></p>

  <p>Dear Friends in Christ,</p>

  <p>Today as I am sitting in my office preparing to write the January newsletter, I realize that the date is the 28th of December, the day we set aside in remembrance of the Holy Innocent. Matthew 2:16-23 gives us that account.</p>

  <p>"Those who sought the young Child's life are dead," but Christ still is King of Kings. He lives in the hearts of millions of people. The gates of hell do not prevail against him and his Church. Those who oppose the Christ Child finally all go down in defeat.</p>

  <p>Through the Wise Men of the East and Scripture, King Herod learned that the newborn King was to be found in Bethlehem. Thinking it over, Herod decides to get rid of the Child. Therefore he orders all the innocent babes to be killed, to make sure that the new- born King would not escape.</p>
  <p>But before Herod could carry out his plot, Joseph, Mary, and the Babe are on their way to Egypt and Herod fails in his unholy scheme.</p>

  <p>After a time the Holy family returns to Palestine. But why? "Those who sought the young Child's life are dead." Evil, wicked, brutal men have had their little day, seemingly triumphant, and no one seems to be able to put a halt to their vicious plans. Righteousness, truth, justice, are tram- pled into the ground. However, when the last chapter is written √ê they are dead.</p>

  <p>Even when Jesus was nailed to the cross, sin did not win the ultimate victory. For that one day the disciples were stunned. They could not understand. The total darkness of the day also entered their thinking. But before the sun went down on that Friday, Jesus exclaimed, "It is finished!" Satan, sin, and death, were defeated, and man was redeemed.</p>

  <p>Through the ages man has tried to wipe out the Gospel by edicts, by war, by ridicule, by criticism. But to this day the Gospel message reaches the ends of the earth to bring salvation, peace, hope, and guidance to sin-troubled and weary souls. They are dead that seek to destroy Jesus and the Gospel. Christ lives forever!</p>

  <br />

  <p>In His Service,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
