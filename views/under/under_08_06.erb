  </center>


  <p>Dear Friends in Christ,</p>

  <p>More than one pastor has returned from conducting a worship service with doubts about his effectiveness.</p>
  <p>The bulletin was checked and rechecked for spelling and grammatical errors&emdash;and still an embarrassing mistake slipped through. Even though he practiced reading through the Scripture lessons, he managed to stumble over the key phrase of the text.</p>
  <p>At a critical point in the pastor's sermon, someone started coughing so persistently that no one could hear what he was saying. Worse yet, in his effort to recover the moment, he lost his train of thought, and it seems doubtful that anyone could have caught the point he was trying to make.
  <p>To his surprise, he learned that the hymns he selected for the day were only familiar to the organist and himself.</p>
  <p>So the pastor is returning home today, disgusted with himself and the less than perfect results for which he had hoped. "The Word of God is worth more than my ability to delivered it to these people God has entrusted to my care," he says. He wonders if he has failed the Lord he serves.</p>
  <p>If any servant of the Lord should have felt like a failure where God had placed him, it would have been the apostle Paul in Thessalonica. Paul's second missionary journey had taken him to Greece. After only a short time in the city of Philippi, Paul had been asked by the city officials to leave. At his next stop, Thessalonica, things went from bad to worse. There he was accused of blasphemy and treason and was forced to leave under the cover of darkness. Hardly a good beginning.</p>

  <p>But Paul says, "Our visit was not a failure." How could he say that? He said it because the Word of God had been proclaimed. People had been called to repent of their sins and to trust in Jesus Christ for forgiveness and salvation.</p>

  <p>That is the only reason any ministry is successful today. If the Word of God is being presented and heard, then the Spirit is successfully at work. The Holy Spirit, not the efforts of the pastor, marks the difference between success and failure. And that is the only thing that counts in worship.</p>

  <p>In His Service,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
