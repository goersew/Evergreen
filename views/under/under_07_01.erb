      <h2>Under the Cross</h2><br />
    <h1>By Faith</h1>
    <p><em>Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. Hebrews 11:1</em></p>
  </center>

  <p>Dear Friends in Christ,</p>
  <p>Chapter 11 in the Book of Hebrews is one of the greatest chapters in the Bible on faith. It is often referred to as the "Heroes of Faith" chapter. A walk through this gallery of saints, this hall of faith, would serve us all well. It would inspire us for the work that our Lord has put before us.</p>
  <p>Verse after verse in this chapter begins with the words, "By Faith." What does the author mean with the word "faith?" It's not guess work, or taking a blind leap. It's not hoping for the best and disregarding the worst. "Faith is being sure of what we hope for." "Being sure" means having solid confidence. Faith brings the future into the present because it makes things hoped for as real as if we already have them. Faith rests on God's eternal Word which 1 Peter 1:25 says, "stands forever."</p>
  <p>New things are and will be happening in our congregation. Already we will have welcomed new members to our boards. With them will come new ideas and a new sense of excitement. Some will come with fear and trepidation, thinking what have I got myself into? Where will I find the strength to accomplish the tasks that lie ahead? Lord, am I up to these tasks, and will you give me the confidence? Our Lord has given us many challenges this year as we go about the work of his kingdom. He has also provided us with many opportunities. And we ask ourselves, "Lord are we up for the tasks you have laid before us? Will you be with us?" His answer is a resounding, "Yes!"</p>
  <p>These are indeed exciting times for us here at Evergreen. How will all these things happen? As in the great chapter on the heroes of faith, God takes ordinary people like you and me and moves us to do extraordinary things.</p>
  <p>And how you will ask, "By Faith."</p>
  <p>In Faith,</p>
  <p>Pastor Ross</p>
